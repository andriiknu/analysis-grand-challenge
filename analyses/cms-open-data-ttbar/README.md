# $t\bar{t}$-analysis
*The RDF $t\bar{t}$-analysis [implementation](rdf_ttbar.ipynb).*

## Short description
- [coffea.ipynb](coffea.ipynb) - Coffea $t\bar{t}$-analysis implementation by [Alex Held](https://github.com/alexander-held)
- [rdf_ttbar.ipynb](rdf_ttbar.ipynb) - RDF $t\bar{t}$-analysis implememtation
- [doc.ipynb](doc.ipynb) - analysis specification
- [validation.py](validation.py) - for sanity checks

## 1. [rdf_ttbar.ipynb](rdf_ttbar.ipynb)
It is a commented notebook showing how RDF works in $t\bar{t}$-analysis pipeline.

For the first run, consider the `Global configurations` section inside the file. Pay attention to the `DOWNLOAD` variable. 
You can download some data files or access them remotely depending on the `DOWNLOAD` value you set (`True` or `False`)

To produce histograms, run it cell by cell. 

## 2. [coffea.ipynb](coffea.ipynb)
Before running it, pay attention to the `INPUT_DATA_INSTALLATION` variable. If you already have downloaded data, set it to `True`.

**Note**: by default, the [rdf_ttbar.ipynb](rdf_ttbar.ipynb) loads data files into the `./input` directory. If there is no folder with this name, it seems you have not downloaded the data.

## 3. [validation.py](validation.py)

Script comparing histograms obtained with Coffea and RDF. 
Histograms saved into root files with names `coffea-N_FILES_MAX_PER_SAMPLE.root` or `rdf-N_FILES_MAX_PER_SAMPLE.root`.

**Note**: the `N_FILES_MAX_PER_SAMPLE` value must be the same for both files you are comparing

The `get_mismatched` method accepts the names of two root files and gives histograms with significant deviations (deviations that pass some threshold).

To get those deviations, you can either run `python ./validation.py --nfiles <nfiles>` or import `get_mismatched` from `validation` and use it in your code.
